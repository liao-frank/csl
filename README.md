## Project Opportunity
The dashboard was built in a partnership with [Phipps Conservatory of Pittsburgh](https://www.phipps.conservatory.org/). The partnership was developed as part of an IT Consulting course at CMU.

Specifically, one building at Phipps focuses on and implements sustainable living - including areas like renewable energy, proper water treatment, and promotion of clean air quality. Phipps came to us with bunch of data and asked us to build a system that would allow them to utilize that data in education programs.

I was the developer and designer in a team of 3 students, which included a project manager and a data scientist.

## Project Outcomes
The product focuses on being both:
- a manageable, extensible content system
- a well-designed, interactable data interface
I developed the dashboard and accompanying CMS from the ground up over the course of one semester.

### Technologies
The product is built with a web framework I developed in a previous semester - [espresso.js](https://devpost.com/software/espresso-js). I took this approach as a challenge to myself to prove the rigor of that previous project.

I also used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
